## Election-Audit Summary
The code made in such a way that a large amount of data can be analyzed without affecting its operation, this is because the code is designed with for loops.
In the same way, the program allows you to automatically determine who was the winner of the elections regardless of the number of candidates and counties in the election, this is because conditionals are used within the code.
